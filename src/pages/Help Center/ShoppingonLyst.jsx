            You can now shop from featured retailers directly on Lyst. Whenever
            you see a product with the "Add to Bag" button, you can place an
            order with the featured retailer through Lyst. The retailer will
            then process, fulfill and deliver the item to you.
          </p>
          <h3 className="head2">Placing Orders</h3>
          <p className="pa1">
            To place an order on Lyst, simply select a size, if necessary, and
            click the "Add to Bag” button. Guest checkout is available although
            we recommend you sign in for faster checkout. You will have an
            opportunity to review your complete order before you submit your
            purchase. We will place your order with the supplying store who will
            send you a confirmation email that the order has been received.

          <p className="para2">Shipping Information</p>
          <p className="pa1">
            ​Shipping options vary by store and delivery destination. We will
            display an estimated shipping cost at the beginning of the checkout
            process. This is based on the best standard domestic options offered
            by the store. As you go through the checkout process you will be
            given the shipping choices as offered by the store for your
            destination.

          <p className="para2">Returns & Exchanges</p>

            checking their website for the most detailed information about
            return policies.
